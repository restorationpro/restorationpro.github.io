<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the steady and sluggish deterioration of materials (generally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust takes place when you combine electrical power, metal, oxygen and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more frequently known as rust). There is no reputable timetable for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal elements typically begin corroding instantly after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of a problem. How fast the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration triggered by a water spill.</p>
