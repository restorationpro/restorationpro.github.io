<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he discovered how much water expense I was paying given that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very polite individual.</p>
