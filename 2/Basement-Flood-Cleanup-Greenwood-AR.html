<p>Mold in the basement can be consistent, provided the nature of basements - they tend to be much more humid than above-ground levels and usually have poor ventilation and little air flow, a mix that can cause mold to flourish. And of course, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to severe weather condition or unnoticed leaks in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, as soon as mold develops, concrete block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>We purchase different equipment including truck-mounted water extractors for expedited removal of floodwaters, power washers to remove debris and soils left by the storm and drying devices such as air movers and dehumidifiers to deal with excess wetness from residential or commercial properties. Our goal is to clean your residential or commercial property to sanitary levels, bring back any damaged areas and dry it to avoid mold or other long-term problems.</p>
<p>After you learn how to eliminate mold, focus on avoiding it in the future. Controlling moisture is the key to stopping most mold. The worst invasions typically happen in damp crawl areas, attics, walls where water leaked in from the outside, and in basements with bad structure drainage. Stopping leakages, making sure good ventilation in attics, keeping crawl spaces dry and routing water far from the foundation are the best defenses versus mold.</p>
