<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold remediation should not simply kill a present growth, however also guarantee mold doesn't find a way to come back. Our 10-year guarantee guarantees that the EPA-registered anti-microbial we use will keep mold from growing back after it is gotten rid of. The anti-microbial is non-toxic and water-based, so you do not require to have any fret about seeping, VOC emissions or other ecological or irritant concerns.
