Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications.</p>

When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.
