<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us survive flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
