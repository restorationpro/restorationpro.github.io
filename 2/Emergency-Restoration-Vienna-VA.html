When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much done in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done appropriately.
