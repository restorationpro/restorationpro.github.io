<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can take place by itself if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier creates the most affordable humidity ratio.

This product acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through warmed exhaust air, the wetness vaporizes (desorption) and is brought outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
