While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this suggests that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
