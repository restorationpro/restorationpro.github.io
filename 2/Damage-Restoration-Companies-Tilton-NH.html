<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
<p>Given that microscopic mold spores exist naturally almost all over, inside your home and outdoors, eliminating all mold from a home or organisation is impossible.

SERVPRO of Lexington, KY has the training and know-how to remediate the mold in your home or service.</p>

<p>Open doors and windows to eliminate moisture and odors if the weather condition permits. If the outside humidity becomes greater than inside, close things up; likewise, close up your house over night if temperature levels drop and damp air may otherwise be drawn inside your home. If windows are stuck tight, remove window strips and eliminate entire sash. If doors are stuck, eliminate door hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then get rid of.</p>
<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>
