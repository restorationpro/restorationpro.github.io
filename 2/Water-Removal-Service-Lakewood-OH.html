<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly damaging. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (often two times a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.
