Correct cleanup after mold removal is necessary to avoid recontamination. You must seal and instantly get rid of materials that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the shoes or boots you wore while cleaning, wash your clothing in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
