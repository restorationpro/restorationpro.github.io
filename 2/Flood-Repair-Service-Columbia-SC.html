<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely destructive. Eventually, the level of damage will determine whether you need to hire an expert or not. Handling significant flood or water damage can be a stressful and scary time for a house owner; generating a professional can help alleviate a great deal of unpredictability.

<p>Get rid of the device from the water as quickly as possible, and get rid of the battery right away. Eliminating the battery quickly could make the distinction to save your phone. A lot of phones have a white indicator near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has damaged the gadget. You can try to draw the moisture out by submerging the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product over night. You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you don't hold the vacuum too close to the device. In some cases cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water long.</p>
