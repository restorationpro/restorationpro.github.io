<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
