<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one unit for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout numerous days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
