<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Indoor mold development can usually be seen or smelled. In most cases, if visible mold development is present, sampling is not needed. There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can use to evaluate a mold sampling outcome. The Florida Department of Health does not recommend mold testing or sampling to see if you have a mold problem, or to see what sort of mold may be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be pricey and, if done, should just be done by skilled professionals. Investigate a mold issue; do not test</p>
