Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite person.</p>
