<p>Rust is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the gradual and slow wear and tear of materials (generally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you combine electricity, oxygen, water and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly referred to as rust). There is no reputable timetable for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal components typically start corroding immediately after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of an issue. How fast the corrosion procedure takes depends on a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid.
