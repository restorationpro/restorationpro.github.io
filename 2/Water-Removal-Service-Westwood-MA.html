<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then clean it away with a moist towel. Just like some of the above methods, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working all right. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
