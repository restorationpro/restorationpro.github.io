<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, mainly triggering respiratory concerns. However in extreme cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can cause pneumonia. When you suspect a mold intrusion, you might want to invest in a mold screening set to see what type of mold spores you're working with, and call in a professional to help with removal. However in the short-term, here are some natural home remedies (made with things you most likely already have on-hand) that will help eradicate mold.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, attempt to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can purchase gadgets to measure relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air flow near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of moisture in the home are all really important in controlling high humidity that frequently causes mold development in our climate.</p>

In addition, once mold develops, cinder block or concrete walls can be hard to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
