<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible signs of wetness, leaking water, or indications of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster material. Other times, you may see small indications like coffee-colored stains that might expand over time.</p>
<p>Our Seattle mold removal, screening, and remediation professionals will seal the area filled with the mold spores, removing the mold and replacing all contaminated floor, ceiling and wall elements. All this, in addition to the complete coordination with your insurance provider, thus finishing our Dri-Cycle Service. You can rely on Pacific Rim in Seattle for mold removal, remediation, and screening services in Washington.</p>
