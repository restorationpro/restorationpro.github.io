<p>The first step to fixing water damage in your home is to identify the source of the water. Sometimes, like broken plumbing or natural disaster, the source will be easily recognizable. Nevertheless, in other cases the cause may be tough to recognize if it is behind a wall or ceiling. Once the source of water is identified you will need to take actions to correct the issue and seal the leakage.

One of the versatile lines from the HVAC system on the fourth floor drained pipes the system and stopped working.<p>
<p>A bleach solution also works to kill mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, use to the surface and do not rinse. As home home appliances age, their pipelines may start to break and rust and their connections or hose pipes can weaken as the products age. Refrigerators, water heaters, washing devices and dishwaters are all have many parts that are vulnerable to wear and tear, so keep a cautious watch on older models. The two biggest perpetrators for water damage in homes are cleaning machines and warm water tanks.<p>
