<h2>Water Damage in Marina - Cleaning and Drying</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings must be included in the drying record to include devices, air, and hvac systems. Moisture material levels for wet structural products must be tape-recorded in a wetness content spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These taped moisture content readings will reveal that the structure is back to an appropriate variety of pre-loss condition. It is essential to understand that air records alone will not show that a structure is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will demonstrate if sufficient dehumidification is being used or if changes are needed.</p>
