<h3>Fire Restoration in Adkins - Fix Your Smoke and Fire Damage</h3>
<p>I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying given that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful individual.<p>
