<h3>Fire And Smoke Restoration in California</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and should be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>Also, since bleach is primarily water, on porous surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily soaked up by the product. So, while you might have wiped off or blemished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact supplied lots of water to regrow and possibly spread the mold underneath the surface. If there is a great deal of mold development, seek advice from the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  variations of these and other assistance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the moldy material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be needed.<p>
