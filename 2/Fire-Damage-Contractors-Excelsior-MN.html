<p>Mold is a fungis that can be found both inside and outdoors. No one understands how many species of mold exist but estimates variety from tens of thousands to maybe 3 hundred thousand or more. Mold spreads and replicates by making spores. Spores can make it through conditions that are too bright, hot, cold, dry or damp for mold to grow. They can be brought by air or water to new locations when spores are launched.</p>
<p>Mold is a major-league nuisance. It blackens the grout lines in your shower, stains drywall, shows up as black areas on siding, darkens decks, and grows on and decays damp wood all over. Even worse, it can be bad for your health. Mold releases microscopic spores that cause allergic reactions, runny noses and sneezing, along with even adverse and annoying smells. We'll cover how to remove mold, how to eliminate black mold, how to kill mold on wood and what eliminates mold in a few actions.</p>
