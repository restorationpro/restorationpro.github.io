<p>Utilize a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it might inadvertently push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. You might attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to suck more water out if the phone was completely submerged. When the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is essential to avoid recontamination. You should seal and immediately deal with materials that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the boots or shoes you used while cleaning, clean your clothes in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
