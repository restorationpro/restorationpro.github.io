<h2>Flood Restoration Services in South Elgin</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>Jake (and his team) are amazing to work with. They were quick to respond at first and provided a reasonable and affordable  quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule quickly and get the work done really quickly. Our mold concern ended up being smaller than first believed so the last billing showed the actual work required and was less than very first estimated.

<p>A lot of mold invasions start small, and may go unnoticed if they are inside a crawl area, duct, or other unobtrusive area. For that reason, your first indication of a mold infestation may be a moldy smell.

If you have an increase in allergic reaction symptoms taking place inside your home, this might also suggest a mold infestation.</p>
