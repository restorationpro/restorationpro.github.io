There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
