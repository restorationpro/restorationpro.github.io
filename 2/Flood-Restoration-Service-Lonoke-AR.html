<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of residential or commercial property damage that a household or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts right away begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working.

If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process.
