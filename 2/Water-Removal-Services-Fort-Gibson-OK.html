<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the existence of a mold issue needing action and the extent of damage then composes a clear scope of work consisting of appropriate standards. This document must plainly explain the actions that will be followed by the remediation contractor, for instance how the afflicted area will be included or what the confirmation criteria are. Without a clear contract in composing the conclusions, data, measurements are delegated the interpretation of each party.</p>
