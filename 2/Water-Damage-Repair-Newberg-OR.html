<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly damaging. Jake and his men were fantastic in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and likewise were very handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we periodically advise disposing of particular types of surfaces and objects. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical products in requirement of disposal.
