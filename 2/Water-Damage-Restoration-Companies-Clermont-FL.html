<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish deterioration of materials (generally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electricity, oxygen, metal and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically known as rust). There is no trusted timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components normally start corroding immediately after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can operate usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How quickly the deterioration process takes depends upon a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
