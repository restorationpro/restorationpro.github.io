<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Search for noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for indications of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
