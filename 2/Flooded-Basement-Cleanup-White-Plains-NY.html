Grapefruit seed extract is terrific to have on hand for different healthcare solutions and likewise cleaning options and potions. What makes it proficient at fighting black mold? Its primary substances are polyphenols, known as limonoids, and naringenin, which help when eliminating bacteria in laundry, cleaning carpet spills (that could result in mold development!), and for disinfecting and sterilizing spaces.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
