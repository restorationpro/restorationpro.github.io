<p>Recent Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
