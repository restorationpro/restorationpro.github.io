<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to five lemons and pour over affected location. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then clean it away with a wet towel. Similar to some of the above methods, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a harsh, corrosive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach also provides off severe fumes and it even produces toxic gas. There are more secure alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce unsafe fumes or leave toxic residue. For these factors try to avoid using bleach and if you must utilize it, just utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
