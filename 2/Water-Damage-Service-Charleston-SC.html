<p>Use a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it might unintentionally push liquid into the phone's more delicate parts. You may attempt vacuuming around the phone's cracks and openings to draw more water out if the phone was completely immersed. When the mold is gone, the chore isn't over yet. Proper cleanup after mold removal is important to prevent recontamination. You must seal and immediately get rid of products that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the boots or shoes you wore while cleaning, wash your clothing in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
