<p>Places that are typically or constantly damp can be hard to maintain completely without mold. If there's some mold in the shower or somewhere else in the bathroom that seems to reappear, increasing ventilation (running a fan or opening a window) and cleaning more often will normally prevent mold from recurring, or at least keep the mold to a minimum. We can supply you with extra services if you require them in addition to your restoration work, consisting of plumbing, general contracting, electrical, and air conditioning and heating.<p>
