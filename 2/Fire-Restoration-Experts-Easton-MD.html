<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, but it can take place on its own if a fire is included. Without proper cleaning, smoke odor remains in clothes, linens, drapes, pillows, clothing and other soft" products for months or longer. Soot and fire residue discolorations typically can't be removed utilizing readily-available family products. IRS Restoration specialists recuperate soft items utilizing the Esporta ES-3300 Wash System Its trademarked, environmentally-friendly cleaning system securely and completely deep cleans, deodorizes and sanitizes soft contents to return them to pre-fire condition.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

Research studies have shown that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at eliminating airborne mold or surface area mold contamination.

Health experts, consisting of the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise the use of ozone to address mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>
