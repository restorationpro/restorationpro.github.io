<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
