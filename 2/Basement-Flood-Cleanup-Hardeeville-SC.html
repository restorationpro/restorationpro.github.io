<p>The location that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can quickly take a trip once they are disturbed. Air purification systems are normally used in combination with the sealing of the area to get rid of as numerous airborne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with unfavorable atmospheric pressure, which prevents the flow of air between the contaminated area and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading out as well.</p>
