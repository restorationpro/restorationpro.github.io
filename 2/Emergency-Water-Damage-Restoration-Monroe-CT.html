Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>

<p>Because mold and mildew can be a serious health risk, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water costs I was paying given that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Very courteous and easy-going person.</p>
