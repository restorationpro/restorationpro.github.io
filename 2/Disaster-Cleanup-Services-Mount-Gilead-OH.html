Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
