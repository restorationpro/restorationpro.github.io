<p>Check the drywall to see how much damage has actually been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Eliminate all compromised drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels only show water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised, they might be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion. When eliminating around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
