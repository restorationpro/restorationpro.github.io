<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his people were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and also were very useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
