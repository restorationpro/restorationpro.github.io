<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development.

Mold assessment is essential to both the safety and health of a home and its occupants. Since mold remediation can often be costly, a mold evaluation performed by a mold specialist is highly recommended.</p>
