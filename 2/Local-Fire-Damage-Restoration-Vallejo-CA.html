<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most terrible things that can occur to a person or a household. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being totally replaced. If there is minor damage then most of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might require fixing. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor may require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The kind of wood flooring you may have identifies and limits the type of repair work that need to take place. Strong hardwood floor covering allows for a wider series of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for specific slabs. The best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>

<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Vallejo</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and must be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
