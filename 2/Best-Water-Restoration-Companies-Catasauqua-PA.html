Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure.
