<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a household or company can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight.</p>
