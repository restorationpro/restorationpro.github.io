<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold specialists generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes. There's no need to wash it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water easily.

<p>If smoke and fire damage has impacted your personal belongings, we will work with you and your insurer to determine what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which penetrates into permeable surface, preventing water from leaking back through. Basically, it makes the area strong once again and secures the surface from future water damage. After you have actually used the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>

<p>The first step to repairing water damage in your house is to recognize the source of the water. In some cases, like damaged plumbing or natural disaster, the source will be quickly recognizable. However, in other cases the cause might be hard to identify if it lags a wall or ceiling. Once the source of water is recognized you will need to take actions to treat the issue and seal the leakage.

<p>Mold Inspection Sciences of Seattle focuses on mold evaluation, mold detection, and mold screening We do not perform mold remediation, hence there are no conflicts of interest.
