Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
