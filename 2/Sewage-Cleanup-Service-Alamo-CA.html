<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job effectively.
