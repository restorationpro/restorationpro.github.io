<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
