To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush till the mold vanishes. There's no requirement to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly.
