<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Experts have actually labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has affected sprawling rural homes, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike.

Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
