<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job correctly.
