<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in Patterson</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is completed.<p>
