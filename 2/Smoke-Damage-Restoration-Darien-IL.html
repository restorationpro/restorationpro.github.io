<p>As moisture is launched in the air, nature constantly tries to reach balance. Computing the humidity is necessary in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid kind if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the humidity rises, the higher the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
<p>A great way to avoid mold from growing in your home is to lower humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, examine your home for leaks. Mop it up rapidly and dry the location if water does enter your home. Also, attempt to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not raining, naturally) or positioning fans in your space. And keep your indoor humidity below 60%.</p>
