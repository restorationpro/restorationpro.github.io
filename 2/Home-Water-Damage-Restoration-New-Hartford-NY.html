<p>Because the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water, getting it damp can develop into a major headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place.

Utilizing bleach on visible mold development is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact people with chemical level of sensitivities especially if used in areas that are not well aerated.
