Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage began, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
