<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

Using bleach on these materials will eliminate the mold above the surface area but the roots within the material will stay and the mold will soon return.</p>
