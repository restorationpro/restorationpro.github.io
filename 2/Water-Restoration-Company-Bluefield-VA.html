<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest step in the procedure is restoration. Restoration includes replacing materials like drywall and insulation. Sometimes this process is as basic as installing a few panels of drywall, while severe cases might need changing entire walls. Exposure to toxic compounds like lead and asbestos is possible throughout restoration. Older homes are likely to contain these compounds.</p>

Never scrape dried mold, otherwise the hazardous spores might spread out into air and trigger negative health impacts.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide eliminates mold as it is anti-fungal as well as anti-viral and anti-bacterial. Hydrogen peroxide is an excellent option to chlorine bleach since it is safe to use and does not damage the environment, nor does it leave toxic residue or produce harmful fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can purchase hydrogen peroxide from drug stores for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
