<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, quick air movement throughout damp surface areas of products or assemblies is an important element of successfully and effectively drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies. Rapid air motion across the surface area of product becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface moisture paves the way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation products. The constant and falling rates of drying products need various criteria for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete).

Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
