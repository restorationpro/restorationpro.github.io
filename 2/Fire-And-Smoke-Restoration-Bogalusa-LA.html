As soon as MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts.

If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very costly paperweight.</p>
