<h3>Why You Should Hire Comstock Park Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repair work, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
