<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke stains. This phase is necessary, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to raise spots from walls. Never ever use soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread the soot and make it impossible to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces beneath. Or simply grab a new sponge. Make certain you use a wiping movement the whole time. If you scrub the spots, you might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface.</p>
