<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
