<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, generally triggering breathing problems. But in extreme cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you think a mold intrusion, you may want to invest in a mold screening set to see what type of mold spores you're working with, and contact a specialist to aid with removal.

<p>The most essential aspect of treating drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. When damp drywall sits with insufficient ventilation, mold and mildew happen most regularly. Regardless of the area or extent of the damage, we advise using dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or comparable machines that can move a big volume of air for maximum ventilation. Basic family fans are not capable of moving an appropriate amount of air required to dry a room effectively.</p>
