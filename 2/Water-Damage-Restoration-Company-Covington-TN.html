<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
