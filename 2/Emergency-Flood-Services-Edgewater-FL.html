<h2>Water Damage Restoration, What All Edgewater Home Owners Need To Know</h2>

<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
