<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his guys were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and likewise were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
