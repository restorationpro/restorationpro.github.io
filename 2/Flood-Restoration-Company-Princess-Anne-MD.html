<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a family or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very costly paperweight.</p>
