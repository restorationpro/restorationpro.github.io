<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall since mold and mildew can be a serious health threat. Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
