<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Water damage, water intrusion, developing envelope issues, and building and construction problems are a very serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing numerous issues due to dripping doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living centers, houses, condos, townhouses, hotels, business buildings are particularly susceptible to these issues as generally the contractor subcontracts the outside envelope work and wall assembly process, for that reason resulting in corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also releases extreme fumes and it even produces harmful gas when blended with ammonia. There are much safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce harmful fumes or leave behind harmful residue. For these factors try to prevent using bleach and if you must utilize it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
