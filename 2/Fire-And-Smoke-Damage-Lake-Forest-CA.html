<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most devastating things that can happen to an individual or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being fully replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might need fixing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor might need changing and in some cases even the subfloor as well. The sort of wood floor covering you may have determines and restricts the type of repairs that need to take place. Strong hardwood flooring enables a broader range of choices to repair the issue.
