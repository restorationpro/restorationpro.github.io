They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.
