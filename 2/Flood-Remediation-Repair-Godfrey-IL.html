<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be dangerous to your health, mainly causing respiratory issues. However in extreme cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia. When you suspect a mold intrusion, you might wish to invest in a mold screening kit to see what type of mold spores you're dealing with, and employ an expert to assist with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home treatments (made with things you most likely already have on-hand) that will help eliminate mold.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can buy gadgets to measure relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air flow near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of moisture in the home are all extremely important in controlling high humidity that frequently triggers mold growth in our environment.</p>

<p>As far as insurance protection is worried, damage caused by surface water intrusion to the house is considered flood damage and is normally left out from protection under traditional homeowners' insurance. Surface area water is water that enters the house from the surface area of the ground because of inundation or inadequate drain and causes loss to the home. Coverage for surface area water invasion to the house would usually need a different flood insurance plan.</p>
