<h3>Dealing With Fire Damage Properly in Tarpon Springs</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health danger and need to be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
