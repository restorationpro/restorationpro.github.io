<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Dawsonville - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health threat and must be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
