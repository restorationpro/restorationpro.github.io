<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
