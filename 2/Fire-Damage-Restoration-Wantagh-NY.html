Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
