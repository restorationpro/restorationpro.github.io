<p>Floor covering water damage. Another sign to try to find is the warping of flooring materials due to water exposure. Flooring water damage can really go unnoticed for a long time if the area is located in the corners of a space or versus a wall. If you see any warping of wood or vinyl 6 floor covering, then the area is likely exposed. Additionally, damp locations of carpet suggest water damage.</p>
<p>When standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any changes.</p>

<p>I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and then even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Very courteous and easy-going individual.<p>
<p>The greatest aspect that can be eliminated is the moisture that mold needs to cultivate. There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, but the most common kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore arrive at a food source that is warm and moist, it begins to colonize and sprout within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots begin to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or harmful gasses are launched as the fungi spreads. Mold in your house can be extremely dangerous and result in a range of health concerns. If the mold in your house is not eliminated correctly it can continue to grow, making efficient mold remediation more expensive and challenging.<p>
