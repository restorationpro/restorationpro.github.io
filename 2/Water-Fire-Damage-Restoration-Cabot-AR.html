<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Cabot</h3>
<p>Flood damage cleanup for wood floorings must be dried slowly. Unexpected drying might trigger splitting or splitting. Some restoration companies can accelerate drying time by forcing air through the fluted underside of hardwood floorboards. Remove hardwood floor boards to prevent buckling. Eliminate a board every couple of feet to lower buckling brought on by swelling. Clean and dry wood prior to attempting repairs.<p>
