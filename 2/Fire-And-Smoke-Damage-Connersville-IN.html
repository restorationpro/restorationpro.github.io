<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible signs of moisture, leaking water, or indications of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may crumble or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster product. Other times, you may discover little indications like coffee-colored stains that might expand with time.</p>
<p>It only takes a small water leak, or even excess humidity, for mold to form in your Cedar Falls home or service. Then, mold can spread rapidly through the residential or commercial property in as low as 48 hours. Mold can produce allergens and irritants, and it has the potential to trigger other health impacts. We can check and examine your home and utilize our specialized devices, training, and know-how to remediate your mold problem if your home or business has a mold problem.</p>

Never scrape dried mold, otherwise the toxic spores might spread into air and trigger negative health effects.</p>
