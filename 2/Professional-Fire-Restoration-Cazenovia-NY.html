<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health hazard and must be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
