<p>The most important element of treating drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew occur most often when moist drywall sits with insufficient ventilation.

Standard family fans are not efficient in moving an adequate quantity of air required to dry a room adequately.</p>

<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health risk and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
