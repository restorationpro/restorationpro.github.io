You can most likely get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets if the damaged location is little. However if you're cleaning an entire room, it's smart to get rid of those clean items and even seal off other spaces that are undamaged. Bear in mind the shoes you're using so you don't track soot discolorations into other rooms.<p>
