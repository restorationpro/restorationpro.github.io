<p>Depending upon the amount of water present and the duration of saturation, you might have the ability to repair the water damage. Heavily saturated drywall will crumble or droop to the touch and should be completely replaced. If the drywall is still safely fastened to studs and the water damaged area is small, you might have the ability to remove a little part of the wall and patch it.
