<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can take place by itself if a fire is consisted of. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier creates the most affordable humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers take in moisture through chemical attraction instead of condensation to get rid of water from the air. A desiccant is a material that holds and brings in wetness. This material acts like a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated up exhaust air, the wetness evaporates (desorption) and is carried outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a harsh, corrosive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach also gives off extreme fumes and it even produces poisonous gas. There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which don't produce unsafe fumes or leave behind harmful residue. For these reasons try to prevent utilizing bleach and if you should utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
