Most phones have a white sign near the battery that will turn pink or red if water has damaged the device. You can attempt to draw the moisture out by immersing the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product overnight. You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near the gadget. Sometimes cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water long.</p>
