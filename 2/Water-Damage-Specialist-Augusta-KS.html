<p>Assessment reports and suits by seven next-door neighbors on the block now declare that building and construction flaws enabled water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test revealed that some parts of their wall had actually likely decayed and established mold. Paper suggested to line the roofing system, instead of the kind needed by the building regulations, was used on the walls. At Jackson's, the stucco was not effectively sealed around some pipes, an inspector said, enabling water to trickle in and travel through her walls.</p>
<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Augusta</h3>
