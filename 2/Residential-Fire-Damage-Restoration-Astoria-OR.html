<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache because the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water.

In the case where drywall does get wet and just begins to droop before drying out, repairing it may simply need pushing it back into location, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
