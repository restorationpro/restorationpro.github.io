<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Mount Airy</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp.

This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
