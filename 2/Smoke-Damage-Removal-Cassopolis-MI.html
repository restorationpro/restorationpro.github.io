Examples of Classification 3 water can include, however are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap despite noticeable material or color; all types of flooding from seawater; ground surface area water and increasing water from streams or rivers; and other contaminated water going into or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from cyclones, tropical storms, or other weather related occasions.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
