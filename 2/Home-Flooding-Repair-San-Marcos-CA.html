<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
