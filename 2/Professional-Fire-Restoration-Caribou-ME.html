<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Caribou</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repair work, bear in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is completed.<p>
