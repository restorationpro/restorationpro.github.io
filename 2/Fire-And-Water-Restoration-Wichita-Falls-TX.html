<p>Numerous highly contagious diseases are linked to water damage including skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, breathing infections, and Weil's illness, as well as kidney, liver, and blood issues. Some of the mold on the surface may be eliminated but the roots of the mold are left intact implying the mold soon returns, leaving you in a cycle of repeated whitening. Possibly this is why some people believe that spraying bleach on mold does not affect it but rather simply bleaches its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
<p>A bleach solution also works to kill mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, use to the surface area and do not wash.

Refrigerators, hot water heater, washing makers and dishwaters are all have many parts that are vulnerable to deterioration, so keep a mindful watch on older designs. The two most significant offenders for water damage in homes are cleaning makers and hot water tanks.<p>
