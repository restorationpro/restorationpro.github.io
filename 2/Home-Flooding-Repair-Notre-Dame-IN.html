<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling due to the fact that of a leaky roofing, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can trigger you anxiety and irritation, especially if you've never done it previously. Mold requires simply three things to survive and grow: wetness, humidity and darkness. The most common locations in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling home appliances, carpets, crawlspaces and ducts. The best method to avoid mold development is to get rid of water leakages or moisture in your house. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention pointers.</p>

Often the terminology of this addendum is similar to "Drain Pipes and sewer Coverage".</p>
