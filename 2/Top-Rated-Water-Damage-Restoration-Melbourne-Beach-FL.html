For products that can be restored, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which permeates into permeable surface, avoiding water from leaking back through. Basically, it makes the location strong once again and protects the surface from future water damage. After you have actually used the Peel-Stop, permit an hour of drying time.<p>
