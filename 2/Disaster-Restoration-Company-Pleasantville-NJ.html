Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just goes away.

These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
