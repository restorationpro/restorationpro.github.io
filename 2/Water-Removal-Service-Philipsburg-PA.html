<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Philipsburg</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
