<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or methods will be the most reliable. It is important to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and offer the very best evaporation results. The greater the number, the much faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>

<p>Since big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged areas larger than 12 square inches may need a total replacement panel set up. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out.
