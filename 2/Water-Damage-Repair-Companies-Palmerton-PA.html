<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most terrible things that can occur to an individual or a household. To restrict damage to individual valuables, remove any products that can be relocated.

First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities especially if used in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more effective at eliminating mold than a moderate cleaning agent and a moist cloth, so we suggest the least toxic option.</p>

Leakages from the roofing will make this area damp, which in turn leads 2 to higher than average mold growth.
