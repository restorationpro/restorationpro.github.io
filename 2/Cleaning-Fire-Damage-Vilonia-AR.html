In order to get an even, ended up look, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is finished.<p>
