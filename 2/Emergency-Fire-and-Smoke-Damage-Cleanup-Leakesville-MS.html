When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewer system can not work properly (common pipes issues in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to lower the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (viruses, bacteria and protozoa).
