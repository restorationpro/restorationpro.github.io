<p>If the wet iPhone is in a case, remove it; take the SIM card out too. (Eliminating the battery wouldn't harm either, however only if you're positive about the technicalities and do not mind voiding the warranty.) These steps help to minimize the number of crannies and nooks where water can remain, and prevent damage to elements. Next, scrub the location to remove all of the mold and mold spots. And lastly, wipe the surface to get rid of recurring mold and spores.<p>
<p>Always carry out mold removal and dry any surface area prior to you paint. Otherwise, it is most likely to peel. Offer your iPhone a wipe down with an absorbent fabric. Wrap a small piece of absorbent fabric around a toothpick or pin, use this to absorb any water from the charging port, headphone jack, and sim card tray. Home insurance coverage may cover water damage, however constantly check with your company before suing. For example, you may need flood insurance coverage if the damage took place due to a flood.<p>
<p>Mold is not a concern to be taken lightly. Mold can affect your health and even the health of your animals. Mold has actually been linked to asthma, sinus problems, and eye burning.
