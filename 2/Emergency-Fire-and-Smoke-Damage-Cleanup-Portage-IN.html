Mold requires simply three things to endure and grow: humidity, moisture and darkness. The most typical locations in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling home appliances, crawlspaces, carpets and ducts.

At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid type.
