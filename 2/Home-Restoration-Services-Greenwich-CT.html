<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Our experience with RestorePro was great. I would 100% advise calling them for aid. As soon as we found our water leak upstairs their mitigation team was here in no time (on a Friday night). Phillip was expert, friendly and helped me comprehend the process of what would be taking place to fix and repair our home. Due to the fact that of their professionalism and attention to detail, I might tell each and every staff member I fulfilled was selected. The completed item was beyond our expectations. I'm really picky about the work that is performed in my home, notice all the information and was impressed with the completed result. Their team dealt with easily with our insurance. When I informed my agent who we called she said Oh, you're in good hands, they're terrific!" I couldn't agree more. Thank you for the work you did in our home. If you are searching for an expert, relaiable and quality restoration company, call RestorePro.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
