<h3>Flood Restoration in West Bloomfield Michigan</h2>
<p>The area that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can easily take a trip once they are interrupted. Air filtering systems are usually used in conjunction with the sealing of the location to get rid of as lots of airborne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the area involves making use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative air pressure, which prevents the blood circulation of air in between the polluted space and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be switched off to avoid the mold from spreading as well.</p>
