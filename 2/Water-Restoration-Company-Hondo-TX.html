<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Not only does mold cause illness if left unattended, however it can also severely damage the structure of your property as well. Nature's main mode of decomposition, mold's primary goal is to breakdown all kinds of organic product; much of it discovered within common structure products. It's important to be proactive and start mold remediation as soon as you find mold in your house or business. Call HCI Fire and Restoration today to begin the mold removal process.</p>
