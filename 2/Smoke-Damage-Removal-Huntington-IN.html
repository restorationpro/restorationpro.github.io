<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to preserve the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can acquire devices to determine relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to decrease the production of moisture in the home are all extremely crucial in managing high humidity that frequently triggers mold growth in our climate.</p>
