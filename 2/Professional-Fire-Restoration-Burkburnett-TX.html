<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth finding out. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.
