They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
