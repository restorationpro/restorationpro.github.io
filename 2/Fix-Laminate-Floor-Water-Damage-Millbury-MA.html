<h3>Importance of Hiring Fire Damage Cleanup Specialist in Millbury</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold specialists normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold vanishes. There's no need to rinse it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly. This might worsen the problem due to the fact that as you know - mold loves damp environments.<p>
