<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
