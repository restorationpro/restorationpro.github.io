<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly tries to reach balance. Determining the dew point is very important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas.

At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas kind. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid type. The greater the dew point increases, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
