<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was easy: It was an ideal storm"-- a combination that lawyers now declare originated from pressure to construct quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure materials, and little federal government and home builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much higher.</p>
