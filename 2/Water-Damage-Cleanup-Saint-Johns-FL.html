Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to sag prior to drying out, repairing it might just need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
