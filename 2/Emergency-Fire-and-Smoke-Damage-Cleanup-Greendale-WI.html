<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of combustible fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - drywall, carpet, or furniture - has been heated up to its special ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and unpredictable gases will be released in the kind of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger long lasting damage and needs to be dealt with by experienced experts, heat is the most obvious, and harmful, item of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire enters contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>Corrosion is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the steady and sluggish deterioration of materials (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you integrate electrical power, metal, oxygen and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no dependable timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal parts usually begin corroding right away after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of a problem. How quickly the rust process takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust caused by a water spill.</p>
