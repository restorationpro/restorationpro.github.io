<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
