<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt how much water costs I was paying given that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Very polite and easy-going person.</p>
