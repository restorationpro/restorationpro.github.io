<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
