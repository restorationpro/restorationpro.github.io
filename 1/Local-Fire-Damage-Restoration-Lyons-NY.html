<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
