<p>One factor is that bleach can not completely kill mold growing in permeable materials. The chlorine in bleach can not penetrate into porous surfaces such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface area of porous materials and only the water component of the bleach is taken in into the material, providing more wetness for the mold to feed on. Final Fixes: The final steps of the fire damage restoration task are the conclusion of repairs. Normally, repair work consist of the replacement of products, painting, and any other repair services that will be needed to restore the home or organisation to its pre-loss condition.<p>
<p>Where the mold lies. Air Conditioning, ventilation, and heating systems need unique cleaning, which can possibly increase costs.
