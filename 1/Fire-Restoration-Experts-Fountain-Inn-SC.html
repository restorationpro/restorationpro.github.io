<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Try to find visible mold development (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water stains, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was basic: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that lawyers now declare came from pressure to construct faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little federal government and builder oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>
