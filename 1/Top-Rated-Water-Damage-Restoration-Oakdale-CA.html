<p>Clean it: Mold is remediated utilizing antimicrobial and biocide agents that are sprayed to suspend or kill any microorganisms. Permeable products like ceiling tiles, insulation drywall and fabric are typically removed. Semi-Porous non-Removable products like wood and concrete can be cleaned with HEPA vacuum, abrasive sanding and hand cleaning. Our specialists will then pressure clean all impacted semi-porous and non-porous structure materials, such as cement, wood, and tile. Then, they will use bactericide in order to reduce the effects of bacteria and other pollutants. Finally, professionals will force-dry the location utilizing commercial structural drying devices.<p>
