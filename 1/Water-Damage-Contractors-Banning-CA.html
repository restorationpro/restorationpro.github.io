As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>After cleaning any affected locations, industrial grade drying devices will be set up to dry your structure.
