<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then clean it away with a wet towel.

For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was a perfect storm"-- a mix that lawyers now allege originated from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building products, and little government and home builder oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
