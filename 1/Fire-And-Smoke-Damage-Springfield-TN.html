<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he discovered how much water bill I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really courteous individual.</p>

<p>When outside humidity levels are high, consider utilizing dehumidifiers to speed up drying. If possible, lease business dehumidifiers, which eliminate 3 to four times more water than home designs. When using dehumidifiers, shut doors and windows. Think about hiring a specialist for water removal if there is extreme flooding in your home. Some companies can dry houses in less than a week with commercial dehumidifiers and air movers.<p>

We put the greatest value on open interaction and customer support and record the entire mold removal procedure.
