Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth.

An unique HEPA vacuum guarantees that even tiny particles get gathered to minimize the chances of the mold moving in other places. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We want to make twice as sure that mold doesn't find an escape of the included work area and into a different part of the structure.</p>
