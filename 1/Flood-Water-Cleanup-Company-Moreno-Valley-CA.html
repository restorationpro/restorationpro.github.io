<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health risk. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
