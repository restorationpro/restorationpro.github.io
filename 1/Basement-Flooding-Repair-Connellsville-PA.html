Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season.
