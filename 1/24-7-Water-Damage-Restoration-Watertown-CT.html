Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater is imminent unless fixed quickly, and the expenses increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The perpetrator may have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>As a naturally happening and prevalent compound in our world, mold exists in a range of various forms-- much of which are non-toxic and mainly affect those with allergic reactions and asthma. Black mold, specifically, however, is a more severe offender. Direct exposure to the harmful range of Stachybotrys chartarum can cause breathing problems ranging from mild to extreme.
