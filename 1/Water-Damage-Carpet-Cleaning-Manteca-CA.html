<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are great for drying in tough to reach areas-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and padding.

With the use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, a sufficient number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a major health danger. Nevertheless, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with full sheets.

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
