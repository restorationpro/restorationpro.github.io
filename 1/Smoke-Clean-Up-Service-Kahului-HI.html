<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible indications of moisture, leaking water, or indications of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might collapse or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you may observe little signs like coffee-colored stains that might broaden gradually.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially check for any security dangers, following OSHA and COIT rules for confined area entry.

We will also check vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them if they have actually been damaged.</p>
