<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to finish the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, because it could inadvertently push liquid into the phone's more delicate parts. You might attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to suck more water out if the phone was totally immersed. When the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is vital to avoid recontamination. You must seal and right away get rid of products that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the boots or shoes you used while cleaning, wash your clothing in hot water, and shower to remove spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
