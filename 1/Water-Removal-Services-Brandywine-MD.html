<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we sometimes advise discarding particular types of surface areas and things. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all common items in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup procedure, which also consists of vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or minor particles neglected in the remediation process. A special HEPA vacuum ensures that even tiny particles get collected to minimize the possibilities of the mold moving in other places. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We want to make twice as sure that mold doesn't discover an escape of the contained work area and into a different part of the building.</p>
