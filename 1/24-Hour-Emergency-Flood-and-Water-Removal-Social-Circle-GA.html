<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Social Circle</h3>
<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Response online, and they were out within the hour. It was a harsh experience, however whatever they provided for me was great. When they were giving me problems, they best thing about First Reaction was that they were able to manage my insurance company. This most likely assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the issue for me, which was a big relief. They were really professional, and I liked everyone I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repairs were handled to my complete satisfaction. I would use them once again.<p>
