<p>Learn how to eliminate black mold securely and efficiently. Make sure to wear adequate protective gear if you choose to handle the mold removal yourself. The CDC suggests that you wear long pants and a long-sleeve shirt, protective gloves and eyeglasses, waterproof boots, and a mask rated a minimum of N-95 or more to secure your nose and mouth. Note that while these masks secure you from little particles like mold, they are not adequate if you are coming across any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>
