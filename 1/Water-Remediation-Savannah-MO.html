<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers.

Part of our tracking process includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air.

Begin wiping the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas beneath. Or merely grab a new sponge. Make certain you use a wiping motion the entire time.
