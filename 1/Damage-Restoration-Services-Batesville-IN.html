If you presume that your Bellevue home or service has a mold problem, SERVPRO of Bellevue West can inspect, evaluate and remediate your home.</p>
<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
