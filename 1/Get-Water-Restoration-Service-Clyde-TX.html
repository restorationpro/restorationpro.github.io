This is an especially important piece of fire damage restoration equipment, as sticking around soot particles can result in illness in a structure's residents after a fire. When filtering mold spores from the contaminated environment, commercial air scrubbers are also important in mold remediation. HEPA filtering makes sure that even the smallest soot or mold particles are gotten rid of from the air.</p>
