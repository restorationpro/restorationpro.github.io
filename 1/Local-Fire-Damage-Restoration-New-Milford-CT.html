Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
