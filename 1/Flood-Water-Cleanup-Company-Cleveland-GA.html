<p>Examination reports and claims by 7 next-door neighbors on the block now declare that building flaws permitted water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test showed that some parts of their wall had likely decayed and developed mold.

At Jackson's, the stucco was not properly sealed around some pipes, an inspector said, allowing water to drip in and travel through her walls.</p>
<h3>Water & Fire Damage Repair‎ in Cleveland</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a long-term health hazard and must be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>A moisture probe, a tool of the trade, can get behind stucco and other exteriors to determine the percentage of water in the walls.
