<p>You want to resolve bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
