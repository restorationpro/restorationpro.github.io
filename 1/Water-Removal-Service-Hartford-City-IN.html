What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
