Using bleach on these materials will kill the mold above the surface area but the roots within the product will stay and the mold will quickly return.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish to resolve using bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Professional Mold Remediation.

<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Doniphan</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health hazard and must be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
