Any products affected by the mold growth need to be gotten rid of, from floor covering materials to books, clothes, and wall boards. Anything non-porous, like glass, can be removed.<p>
<p>In advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: major leakage or glowing floor heating leak), fixing the subfloor may even be required. For finest results, refinish the whole space, as trying to repair a small area will show up for many years, supplying an apparent sign that the floor has had some kind of damage. You can tell if your screen has been damaged by water if there are lines or dark areas under the glass. It is difficult to say whether this damage is going to be permanent or if it will lead to other complications, so the best thing to do is turn it off and leave it to dry for as long as possible.<p>
<p>If you're dealing with a smaller hole (up to 6"), apply a thin layer of joint compound around the hole. Position your patch into the hole. Utilizing a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Feather the edges of the substance and enable it to dry. Sand gently with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a second layer of joint substance to finish the repair.
