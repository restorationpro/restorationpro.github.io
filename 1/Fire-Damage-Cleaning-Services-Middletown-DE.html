<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
