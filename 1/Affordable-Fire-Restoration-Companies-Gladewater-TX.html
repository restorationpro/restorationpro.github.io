<p>Mold is practically everywhere, floating in the air and on all surface areas. Individuals are exposed to molds 24 hr a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Exposures increase when indoor moldy materials becomes dried, damaged or interrupted, triggering spores and other mold cells to be released into the air and then inhaled. Raised direct exposure can also occur if people directly deal with moldy products or unintentionally consume mold.</p>
