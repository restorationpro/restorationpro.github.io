<p>One reason is that bleach can not entirely kill mold growing in porous materials. The chlorine in bleach can not permeate into permeable surface areas such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface area of porous materials and only the water component of the bleach is absorbed into the material, supplying more moisture for the mold to feed upon. Last Fixes: The last actions of the fire damage restoration job are the conclusion of repairs. Normally, repairs consist of the replacement of products, painting, and any other repair services that will be needed to bring back the home or service to its pre-loss condition.<p>
<p>Just remember that this is most likely to invalidate any service warranty coverage you've got, and there's a danger that your Do It Yourself work will trigger damage instead of repair it.
