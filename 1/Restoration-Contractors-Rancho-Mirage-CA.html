<p>One reason is that bleach can not entirely kill mold growing in porous materials. The chlorine in bleach can not permeate into permeable surface areas such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface area of porous materials and only the water component of the bleach is absorbed into the material, supplying more moisture for the mold to feed upon. Last Fixes: The last actions of the fire damage restoration job are the conclusion of repairs. Normally, repairs consist of the replacement of products, painting, and any other repair services that will be needed to bring back the home or service to its pre-loss condition.<p>
<p>Just remember that this is most likely to invalidate any service warranty coverage you've got, and there's a danger that your Do It Yourself work will trigger damage instead of repair it. If you can currently see it, you normally do NOT need to spend money on pre-testing mold Plain and basic: you just need to eliminate it. Since no visible mold development belongs in a healthy home (no matter what the type) and all mold need to be removed the very same way, there is typically no requirement to identify what types and concentrations of mold you have via testing.<p>
