<p>Using bleach or other chemicals to eliminate indoor mold development is not needed in most cases. The goal should be to get rid of mold growth by cleaning or removing musty products. Dead mold can still present health threats if you are exposed. Using bleach or other disinfectants on surfaces after mold removal may be needed where people are believed to be susceptible to fungal infections (such as an individual with immune system issues). Must you decide to use bleach or another chemical, please read and thoroughly follow the label directions and risk statements (care, warning, risk). Do not mix bleach with ammonia cleaners or acids, since a dangerous chlorine gas may be formed.</p>

Ensure that you get to the origin of the molds and you need to open up the walls to discover them. Scrub the surface areas with a mold cleaner and do this completely.
