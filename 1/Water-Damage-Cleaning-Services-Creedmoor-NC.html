<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
