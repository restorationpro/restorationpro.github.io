<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Really respectful and easy-going person.</p>
