These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
