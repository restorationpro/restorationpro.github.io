<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a household or service can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working.

If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>
