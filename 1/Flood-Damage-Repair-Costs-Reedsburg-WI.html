<p>If the wet iPhone remains in a case, eliminate it; take the SIM card out too. (Getting rid of the battery would not injure either, but only if you're positive about the technicalities and don't mind voiding the warranty.) These actions help to minimize the variety of nooks and crannies where water can stick around, and prevent damage to components. Next, scrub the location to remove all of the mold and mold spots. And finally, wipe the surface area to eliminate residual mold and spores.<p>
<p>In addition, although ammonia can kill surface area mold, dead mold and dead mold spores are still allergenic so you will need to make sure to eliminate them later on. A most likely circumstance, sadly, is that your iPhone was turned on, or in sleep mode, when you dropped it in the drink. So you're looking at two unappealing alternatives: power down (however in the process cause the screen and os to awaken briefly before switching off) or leave the device in sleep mode and hope you do not get any notifications.<p>
