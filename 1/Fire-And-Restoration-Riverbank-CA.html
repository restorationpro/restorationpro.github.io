<p>Because common building products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Examine the drywall to see just how much damage has been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Get rid of all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to eliminate it. They might be repairable by cutting out the damaged part if drywall panels only reveal water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised. When cutting out around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
