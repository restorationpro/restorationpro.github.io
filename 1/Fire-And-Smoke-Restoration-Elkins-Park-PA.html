Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged specialist on the biological elements of air pollution, this team was designated to verify and test the brand-new technology.

So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a crucial tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job correctly.
