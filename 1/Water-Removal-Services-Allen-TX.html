<p>The most important element of remedying drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. When wet drywall sits with insufficient ventilation, mold and mildew occur most regularly. Despite the location or level of the damage, we advise using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or similar devices that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Standard family fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate quantity of air needed to dry a space effectively.</p>

<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are terrific for drying in tough to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are preferable when drying under carpet and cushioning. Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air across wet surface areas, evaporating moisture into the air. With using warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, a sufficient number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly tries to reach equilibrium. Computing the humidity is very important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point constantly takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas kind. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid type. The greater the humidity increases, the higher the quantity of wetness in the air.</p>
