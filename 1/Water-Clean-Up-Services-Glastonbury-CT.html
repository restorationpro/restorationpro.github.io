Therefore, people will work to include a fire without focusing on smoke damage prevention. Smoke is somewhat harder to see than the fire itself and seems less threatening. Likewise, because it's in the air, it's nearly impossible to include. Even after a fire is snuffed out, smoke in the air can cause damage. Smoke damage restoration services are often required to restore damage left behind from little indoor fires.</p>
