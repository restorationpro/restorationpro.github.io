<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

If there is a great deal of mold development, consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  versions of these and other guidance documents are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the musty product is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be essential.<p>
