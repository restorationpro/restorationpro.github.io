<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his guys were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and likewise were very valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>Remove the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and get rid of the battery immediately. Eliminating the battery rapidly might make the distinction to conserve your phone.
