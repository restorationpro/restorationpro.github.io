<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or methods will be the most reliable. It is vital to figure out if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and hidden energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure materials and how they respond to each one and provide the very best evaporation results. The greater the number, the faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
