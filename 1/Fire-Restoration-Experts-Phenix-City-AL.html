<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job correctly.
