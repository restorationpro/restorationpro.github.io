Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying given that the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful person.</p>
