<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in West Orange</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health danger and should be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide eliminates mold effectively on many products such as clothing, floors, restroom fixtures, products and walls such as kitchen devices. Given that hydrogen peroxide is a whitening agent it might also help fade the stain mold leaves behind.
