<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As pointed out, quick air motion throughout damp surfaces of assemblies or products is a critical component of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess moisture within the products or assemblies. Rapid air movement across the surface of product becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area wetness gives way to reducing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials need different criteria for changing conditions.</p>
