Carolina Water Damage Restoration is a fantastic company.</p>
<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments.</p>
