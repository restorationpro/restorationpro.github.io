<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for every 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it passes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
