<p>Secure Non-Damaged Areas- When containment barriers are established we will begin eliminating the damp dry wall and begin to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which allows the carpet to dry. We will also move furniture out of the damp areas to guarantee that all excess wetness inside a wall or under a floor is dried, so no mold issues emerge later.<p>
<p>To eliminate mold: Use white distilled vinegar and pour it into a spray bottle without watering it down. Spray the vinegar onto the musty surface area and leave it to sit for an hour. Lastly, clean the location clean with water and enable the surface to dry. Any odor from the vinegar must clear within a couple of hours.
