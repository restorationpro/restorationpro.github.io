<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
