<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a wide area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
