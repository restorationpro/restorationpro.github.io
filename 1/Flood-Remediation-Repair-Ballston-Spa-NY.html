<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the starting point for numerous major problems that can impact a building, damage personal effects and present severe health dangers to occupants.

Additionally, they should be able to communicate with the water damage victims and insurance provider representatives with confidence and authority.
