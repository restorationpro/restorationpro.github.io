<h3>Fire Damage Contractors in Rancho Cucamonga</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold experts normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the service on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no requirement to wash it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This might exacerbate the problem since as you know - mold loves moist environments.<p>
<p>Any sources of water, humidity, or moisture should be dealt with and completely dried prior to mold remediation can begin due to the fact that mold flourishes in moisture.
