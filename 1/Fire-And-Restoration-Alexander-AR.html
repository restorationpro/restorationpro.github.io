<p>To get wetness out of the iPhone's interior, you require a desiccant. Lots of people swear by raw rice, advising owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the stuff (cover it totally) and leave it there for two days or two. A: Mold is a tiny fungi that becomes part of the natural environment and necessary for our community. While it is necessary in the outdoor world, too much mold inside a structure can be dangerous and unsanitary. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores float through the air both inside and outside.<p>
