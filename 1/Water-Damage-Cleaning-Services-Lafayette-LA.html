<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also obtain nutrients from some artificial products such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs wetness, although some mold types can get that wetness from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Thoroughly pry baseboards far from walls so that you can examine sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can quickly soak up flood water, and you need to understand the degree of prospective damage.<p>
