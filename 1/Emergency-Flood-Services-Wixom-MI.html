<p>Flooding can cause serious damage to a commercial structure. Whether it's triggered by heavy rain, overruning waterways, or damaged plumbing, the water should be gotten rid of and the building's contents need to be rapidly dried to avoid structural damage, mold development, and other problems.

But you can manage mold development by keeping your home dry.<p>
<p>Removing among the 3 requirements for mold decreases (or gets rid of) new mold development: moisture; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat considering that mold usually does not grow in cold environments.
