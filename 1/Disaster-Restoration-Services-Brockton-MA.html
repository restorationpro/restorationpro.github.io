<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The most important element of fixing drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew happen most regularly. Regardless of the location or extent of the damage, we recommend using dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or similar makers that can move a big volume of air for maximum ventilation. Standard family fans are not capable of moving a sufficient amount of air required to dry a space sufficiently.</p>

In addition, when mold establishes, concrete block or concrete walls can be challenging to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
