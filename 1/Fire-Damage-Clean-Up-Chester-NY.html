<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. As soon as InstaScope was created, we engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide recognized professional on the biological aspects of air pollution, this team was designated to confirm and evaluate the new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to produce a new mold-assessment system for business customers that, unlike any other technique or gadget, can provide clinically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly.

You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near to the gadget. Often cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has actually not been exposed to water long.</p>
