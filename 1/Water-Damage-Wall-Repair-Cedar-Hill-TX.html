These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days.
