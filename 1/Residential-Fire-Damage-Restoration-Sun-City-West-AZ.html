<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
