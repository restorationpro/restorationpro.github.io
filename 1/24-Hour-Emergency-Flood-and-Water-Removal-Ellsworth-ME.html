<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier gets rid of water vapor from the air using a procedure called condensation. LGR dehumidifiers continue to eliminate a significant quantity of water vapor listed below 40 grains per pound. LGRs are a special kind of residential and industrial grade refrigerant dehumidifiers since they are much more energy efficient and they can pull the grains down much lower. LGR dehumidifiers use a double cooling or boosted step to decrease the moisture-laden air temperature level when inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
<p>It is primarily standing water that triggers mold formation. It can leak into porous surfaces, and those materials can end up being reproducing grounds for damaging molds and fungi.
