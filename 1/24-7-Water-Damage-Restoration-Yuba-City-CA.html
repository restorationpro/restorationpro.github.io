<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Some air cleaners are created to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing representative and a recognized irritant of the lungs and respiratory system. Research studies have shown that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at killing airborne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was eliminated by ozone, the health dangers would not be minimized up until mold contaminants are removed through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise making use of ozone to resolve mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>
