It's an unfortunate fact that iPhones get dropped and damaged all the time. Most likely the most typical is the smashed screen, which we talk about in our article on getting a damaged iPhone fixed But the second most common is water damage. Parts of a water-damaged home might need to be rebuilt. Products like drywall and carpet that have actually soaked up water often develop bacteria and mold that can't be removed. Changing these products is much safer than enabling transmittable organisms to fill the air.<p>
