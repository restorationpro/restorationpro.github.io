<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might sag or crumble under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous gypsum product. Other times, you might discover small indications like coffee-colored discolorations that might broaden gradually.</p>
<p>Given that tiny mold spores exist naturally practically everywhere, indoors and outdoors, eliminating all mold from a home or company is difficult. Many restoration services promote mold removal" and even guarantee to remove all mold. This is a misconception. We understand mold and mold growth. SERVPRO of Lexington, KY has the training and know-how to remediate the mold in your home or service.</p>

<p>When a client calls with a water damage emergency, our group is prepared to react immediately.

The longer a water damage scenario is left unresolved, the more damage occurs and the issue will end up being more expensive to repair.</p>
<p>These steps need to be laid out by an expert, certified as a mold assessor or in mold removal, and are based on the ANSI IICRC S500 Professional Standard for Water Damage and the ANSI IICRC S520 Professional Standard for Mold Remediation.

<p>We will do our finest to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for a time period, end up being permanently damaged (i.e. they will never be the exact same). Other products might just need to be decontaminated and transferred to high ground. Soft products like clothing, bedspreads, drapes can be sent out to a laundry service that we can schedule you. Another point is, there are various levels of contamination with water (see Classifications of Water), and that will factor into the equation of what can be saved and what ought to be changed. We will deal with you throughout the loss, setting aside products that we feel can not be effectively restored so you can make a list to turn into your insurance adjuster. Your Adjuster will then determine a repayment for your products according to the terms of your policy.</p>
