<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
