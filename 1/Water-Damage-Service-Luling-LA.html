<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As discussed, quick air motion across wet surfaces of assemblies or products is a critical component of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air movement across the surface area of product becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface wetness paves the way to minimizing moisture material in low evaporation products. The consistent and falling rates of drying materials require different criteria for altering conditions.</p>

Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
