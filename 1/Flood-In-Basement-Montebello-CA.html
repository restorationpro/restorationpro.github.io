<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out how much water bill I was paying because the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.<p>
