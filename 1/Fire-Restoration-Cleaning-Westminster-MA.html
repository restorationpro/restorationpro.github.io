<p>Before you clean the house, you need to wear appropriate defense. Smoke, particles and soot can be dangerous to inhale, so wear a respirator if there is considerable soot in the damaged area. Wear long sleeves and pants to secure your skin. You ought to also use gloves and eye protection.

Be mindful of the shoes you're wearing so you do not track soot stains into other rooms.<p>
