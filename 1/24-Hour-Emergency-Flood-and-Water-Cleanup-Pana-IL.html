<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Ceilings exposed to water damage are more at danger due to gravity: You don't desire them sagging or collapsing. So, eliminate affected ceiling panels or boards initially.

<h3>Flooded Basement Repair in Pana Illinois</h2>
<p>We recently had significant water damage due to a washing machine overflow. Rainbow came out to your home on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action needed to avoid more damage working late into the night. They also finished the whole dry out which took a number of days and a great deal of effort. Constantly arrived on time and did what they assured and kept me informed of each action. It was a satisfaction to deal with the whole team. I would not think twice to advise them for any work of this nature including mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>Jake (and his group) are awesome to deal with. They were quick to react at first and offered a reasonable and affordable  quote. They had the ability to fit us into their schedule promptly and get the work done extremely quickly. Our mold problem ended up being smaller sized than first thought so the final billing reflected the real work required and was less than first quoted. Jake was really responsive to calls and emails addressing questions throughout the procedure. All in all, I had a very good experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
