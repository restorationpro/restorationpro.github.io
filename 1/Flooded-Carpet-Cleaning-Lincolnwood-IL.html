<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his people were fantastic in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and also were very helpful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
