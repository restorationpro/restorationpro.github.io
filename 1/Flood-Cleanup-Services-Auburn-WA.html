<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any modifications.</p>
