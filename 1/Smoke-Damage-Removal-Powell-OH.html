<p>It's a demanding circumstance when water floods your floorings, soaks into your walls, and damages your furniture. Given that a carpet cleaner can just do so much, you need a water damage cleanup team that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) take in wetness like a sponge. Place water-permeable bundles of desiccants and wet items in airtight containers or in sealed locations, like closets. Some desiccants change color to suggest they are saturated, which can take days or weeks, depending on just how much moisture products consist of.<p>
