<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold is a typical perpetrator of damage in much of our homes and organisations here in Central Illinois. When wetness is present, mold spores can spread rapidly. Typically it can take hold in less than 2 days after a wetness damage has actually taken place.
