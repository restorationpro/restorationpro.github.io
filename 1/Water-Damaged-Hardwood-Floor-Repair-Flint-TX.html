<p>The most important element of treating drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. When wet drywall sits with insufficient ventilation, mold and mildew occur most often. Regardless of the location or extent of the damage, we encourage utilizing dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or similar makers that can move a big volume of air for maximum ventilation. Standard family fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient quantity of air needed to dry a room sufficiently.</p>
