We have actually brought structure and contracting experience into our franchise over the past two and a half years to much better serve our communities after suffering a natural disaster.</p>
<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
