<p>These are generally great signs of mold, possibly dangerous and absolutely something you want to get rid of. The taxonomic name for the greenish-black mold that shows up on ceiling, carpet, and wallpaper tiles is Stachybotrys Chartarum or Black Mold. It produces a mycotoxin, microscopic mold spores, that triggers mycotoxicosis. This is not something you can tidy up utilizing a sponge and a store vac. This needs licensed mold removal, mold testing, and black mold remediation experts in Seattle, like those from Pacific Rim CR LLC.<p>
