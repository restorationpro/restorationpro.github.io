<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to do the job effectively.
