Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
