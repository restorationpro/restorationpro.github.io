<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. Once this combustible fuel - drywall, carpet, or furnishings - has been heated to its unique ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and volatile gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger long lasting damage and should be handled by skilled specialists, heat is the most noticeable, and damaging, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire comes into contact with extra fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>After you find out how to eliminate mold, concentrate on avoiding it in the future. Controlling dampness is the crucial to stopping most mold. The worst invasions normally take place in damp crawl areas, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outside, and in basements with bad foundation drainage. Stopping leakages, ensuring good ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water away from the structure are the very best defenses versus mold.</p>

The worst problem with mold is that it has the potential to trigger health impacts. Mold can activate allergic reactions and even asthma attacks, as some people dislike mold.
