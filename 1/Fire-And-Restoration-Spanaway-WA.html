<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
