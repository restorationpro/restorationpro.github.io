Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted sprawling suburban homes, starter houses, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties constructed with materials aside from stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>We are thought about one of the very best mold remediation companies in Dallas, TX. We take mold remediation very seriously at Water Mold Fire Restoration and follow a well-planned remediation procedure.

If you presume that your house or parts of your house have mold, offer us a call and we will send someone right away for an inspection. In the case of no visible mold, we can offer an inspection and notify you if there is a problem present; in fact, we can even test the mold sample to see its degree and make a plan of action. You can even send us a photo of the mold in your home if you spot it on permeable surfaces such as a drywall, wood or curio, and ask for free assistance.</p>
