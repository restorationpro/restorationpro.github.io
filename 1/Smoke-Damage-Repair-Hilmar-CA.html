<p>Any structure that has actually struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at risk of mold growth. Use a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore protection, and cover legs, hands and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold. If the musty location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will lower the occurrence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use industrial black mold removal items, which can be found in most hardware or home repair shops, to disinfect the musty locations, in addition to any surrounding areas.
