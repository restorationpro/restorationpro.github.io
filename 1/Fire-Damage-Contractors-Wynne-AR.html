<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible signs of wetness, dripping water, or signs of stopping working structural integrity.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have ended up being polluted with molds.

When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
