Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.<p>
