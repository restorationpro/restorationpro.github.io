It was a severe experience, but whatever they did for me was great. When they were giving me issues, they finest thing about First Response was that they were able to manage my insurance coverage company. This most likely helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the issue for me, which was a huge relief. They were really professional, and I liked everybody I handled from the company.

<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
