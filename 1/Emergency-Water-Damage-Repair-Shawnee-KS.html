<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), likewise in some cases referred to as mildew, is a fungal growth that establishes on damp products. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a fundamental part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold growth should be avoided. Mold recreate by ways of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, however unnoticeable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature level, wetness, and available nutrient conditions are proper, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are transferred. 1 There are numerous kinds of mold, but all need wetness and a food source for development.</p>

<p>Lastly, we want to deal with the use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Professional Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical sensitivities especially if utilized in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more effective at removing mold than a moderate cleaning agent and a moist cloth, so we suggest the least harmful option.</p>
<p>A great way to prevent mold from growing in your house is to reduce humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, check your home for leaks. Mop it up quickly and dry the area if water does enter your home. Also, attempt to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not raining, of course) or placing fans in your space. And keep your indoor humidity listed below 60%.</p>
