Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
