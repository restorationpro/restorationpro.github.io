Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
