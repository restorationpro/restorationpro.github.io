Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is great and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier because it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning. As soon as the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
