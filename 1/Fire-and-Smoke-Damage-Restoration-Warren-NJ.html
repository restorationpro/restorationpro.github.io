<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too.

When the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the specialist will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is considered to complete.<p>
