<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repair work. By decreasing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
