Usage of Negative Pressure - With the assistance of unfavorable air makers geared up with HEPA filters, we can guarantee dust, mold spores, and other damaging microbial product will remain within the impacted areas during the restoration process. Considering that HEPA filtration captures 99.7% of microbial matter, our makers supply an extra layer of security to the occupants of the home as remediation happens.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache since the plaster drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place.
