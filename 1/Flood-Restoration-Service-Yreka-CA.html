<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find signs of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
