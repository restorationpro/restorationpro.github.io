<p>To get moisture out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many individuals swear by uncooked rice, advising owners to put their wet iPad or iPhone in a big bowl of the stuff (cover it completely) and leave it there for 48 hours or so. A: Mold is a microscopic fungus that is part of the natural surroundings and required for our community. While it is required in the outside world, excessive mold inside a structure can be unhygienic and dangerous. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores float through the air both inside and outside.<p>
<p>Generators: When it comes to water damages that cause the loss of power, it is essential for the service technicians to have a power supply.
