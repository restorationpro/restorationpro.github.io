<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air movement throughout damp surfaces of assemblies or materials is a vital element of successfully and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess moisture within the materials or assemblies.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors.

While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
