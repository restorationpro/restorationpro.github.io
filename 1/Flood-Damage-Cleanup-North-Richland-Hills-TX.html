The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

We dried the carpet and pad in location and utilized HEPA air scrubbers to keep the air clean during the process. Due to the fact that of our drying methods and devices, reconstruction was unneeded.</p>
