<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repairs. By decreasing the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is finished.<p>
