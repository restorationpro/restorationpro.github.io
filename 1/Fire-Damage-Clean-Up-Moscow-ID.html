<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground.

Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is good and moist, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
