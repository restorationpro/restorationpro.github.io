<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Newark</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health threat and need to be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
