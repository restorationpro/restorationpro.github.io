<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling since of a dripping roofing, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you stress and anxiety and aggravation, specifically if you've never ever done it in the past. Mold needs simply three things to make it through and grow: darkness, moisture and humidity. The most typical locations in your home for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling home appliances, crawlspaces, carpets and ducts. The very best method to avoid mold growth is to eliminate water leakages or moisture in your home. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention ideas.</p>
<p>After a residential or business water emergency - such as a flooded basement, sewer backup, and even damage from winter season storms and ice dams - every second that ticks creates more damage to your home or company.

<p>It is easy for a homeowner to believe the damage to their home or business is restricted to the visually validated damage. At FP Property Restoration, we understand that this is not the case.

Avoid mold by keeping surface moisture and humidity to a minimum, and then take on areas as soon as they show up to stop its spread. Throughout every step of the process, we manage your personal belongings with utmost care.
