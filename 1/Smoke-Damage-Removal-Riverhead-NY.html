<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation process is thought about to complete.<p>
