<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was an ideal storm"-- a combination that lawyers now declare originated from pressure to build faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and contractor oversight. Contribute to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much higher.</p>

<p>The location that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can easily travel once they are disrupted. Air filtering systems are normally used in conjunction with the sealing of the area to eliminate as lots of airborne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative air pressure, which prevents the flow of air in between the infected space and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be shut off to prevent the mold from spreading also.</p>

You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
