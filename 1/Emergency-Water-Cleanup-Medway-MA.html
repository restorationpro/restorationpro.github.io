<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually ended up being polluted with molds.

<p>Because it's difficult to eliminate mold in your house entirely, it is essential to keep your air clear by routinely changing air filters.
