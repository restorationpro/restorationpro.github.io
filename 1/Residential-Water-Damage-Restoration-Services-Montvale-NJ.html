Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
