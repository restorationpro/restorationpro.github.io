<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and must be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
