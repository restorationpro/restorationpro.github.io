<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible indications of moisture, dripping water, or indications of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may fall apart or droop under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable gypsum product. Other times, you might see small indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand in time.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache since the plaster drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get damp and simply begins to droop before drying, fixing it might simply need pressing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
