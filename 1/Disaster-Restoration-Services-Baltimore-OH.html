<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Baltimore</h3>
<p>Check the drywall to see how much damage has been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Remove all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels just show water discolorations but aren't structurally jeopardized, they might be repairable by cutting out the damaged part. When cutting out around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
