<p>Unfavorable air makers, geared up with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air filters") need to be made use of to get rid of bacteria and other impurities from the air throughout restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be drawn out with self-contained vacuum devices with proper waste holding tanks which should be gotten rid of appropriately. Difficult surface areas that are affected should be cleaned and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, rug, plaster wallboard should be eliminated and effectively disposed of.
