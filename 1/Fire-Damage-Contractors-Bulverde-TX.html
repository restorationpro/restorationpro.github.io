<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Really courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
