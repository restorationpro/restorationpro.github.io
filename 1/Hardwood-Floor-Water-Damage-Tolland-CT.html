<p>Vapor pressure is straight related to humidity ratio (particular humidity or grains per pound-gpp and dew point). As heat is used to a product, energy is added. Raising the temperature of a damp product increases the rate of evaporation, more launching wetness from the material and changing the internal vapor pressure. The higher the difference between ambient temperature level and humidity temperature level, the greater the capacity for faster and more efficient drying.</p>
