Molds is available in several forms; in fact, according to the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, there are most likely 10s of thousands of types of molds, if not more. Molds play an essential role in breaking down leaves, trees and plants.

<p>Water damage develops from damaged pipelines, blocked drains, malfunctioning home appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends on the nature of the damage.
