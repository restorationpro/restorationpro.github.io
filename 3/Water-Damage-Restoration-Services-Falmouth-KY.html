<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears.
