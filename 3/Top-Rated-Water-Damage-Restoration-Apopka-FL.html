<p>Learn how to remove black mold safely and successfully. When you have water damage and aren't sure right away from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or damaged pipes can be a major headache. Sprinkler line pipeline burst often goes undetected up until the water comes rushing through basement window wells and walls triggering significant basement water damage.

<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
