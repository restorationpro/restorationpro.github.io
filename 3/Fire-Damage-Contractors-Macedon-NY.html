If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and need to be removed.

This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
