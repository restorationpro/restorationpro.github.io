According to a claim by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, craftsmanship was so bad that, even prior to the household relocated, a mushroom grew in the floorboard of their 20-month-old child's bed room.</p>
<p>Negative air devices, geared up with HEPA (high efficiency particle air filters") must be made use of to get rid of germs and other impurities from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage need to be extracted with self-contained vacuum equipment with correct waste holding tanks which need to be disposed of effectively. Hard surface areas that are affected must be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural products such as carpets, carpet pads, plaster wallboard should be gotten rid of and correctly gotten rid of.

<p>Since mold and mildew can be a severe health threat, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of as much as 18 inches of drywall.

As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to change the damage with complete sheets.

<p>BRAVO - job well done! Found a flood in the house in San Francisco - water had been over streaming a 2nd floor sink for 15 hours. Called Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of devices to alleviate the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were placed on hardwood walls, floors and ceilings were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Excellent, professional care. Very pleased with their swift shipment of emergency service AND their attention to information to guarantee the water damage was dried out completely.</p>
