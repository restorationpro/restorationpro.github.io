Search for noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, silky, rough, or tough and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper).
