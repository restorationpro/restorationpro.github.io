<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As mentioned, quick air movement throughout wet surface areas of materials or assemblies is a critical element of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the materials or assemblies. Fast air motion across the surface of product ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface wetness paves the way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The consistent and falling rates of drying materials need different criteria for changing conditions.</p>
