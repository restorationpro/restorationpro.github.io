<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Because typical structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
