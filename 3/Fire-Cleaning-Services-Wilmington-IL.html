<p>Mold Containment. The source of the moisture issue is attended to and the afflicted location is blocked to avoid contaminating the rest of your home with mold spores stimulated during the removal process. The intact items that are safe from original flood damage can get messed up because it is soaking up wetness from the air if the internal humidity of the structure isn't controlled. The structures that are not dried correctly or quick enough will work as food sources for mold. This will later result in a more pricey mold removal services.<p>

Tape plywood or cardboard around the window openings so the spores can't blow back in<p>
