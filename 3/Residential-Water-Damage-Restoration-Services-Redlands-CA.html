<h3>Water Damage Restorers in Redlands California</h2>
<p>Water can be damaging. When it meets the drywall that makes up your interior walls and ceilings it can make them look undesirable-- or worse, it can damage wallboard enough that it collapses and breaks down, which can trigger big homeowner headaches.

Discover how to do it yourself with this step-by-step repair guide.</p>
<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a major health risk. Nevertheless, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>

A more serious storm or deeper flood might add damage to a lot more expensive systems, like: ducts, the heating system and air conditioning system, roof, personal sewage and well systems, utilities, and the structure.</p>
