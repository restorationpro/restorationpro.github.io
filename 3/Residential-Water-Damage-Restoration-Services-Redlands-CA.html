<h3>Water Damage Restorers in Redlands California</h2>
<p>Water can be damaging. When it meets the drywall that makes up your interior walls and ceilings it can make them look undesirable-- or worse, it can damage wallboard enough that it collapses and breaks down, which can trigger big homeowner headaches.

Discover how to do it yourself with this step-by-step repair guide.</p>
<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a major health risk. Nevertheless, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>When your home floods, the water can ruin the structure of your house, your personal belongings, and the health of the inside environment. Flood waters include many pollutants and lots of mud.

A more serious storm or deeper flood might add damage to a lot more expensive systems, like: ducts, the heating system and air conditioning system, roof, personal sewage and well systems, utilities, and the structure.</p>
