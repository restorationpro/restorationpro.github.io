Air filtration systems are normally used in combination with the sealing of the location to get rid of as numerous air-borne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the area involves using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative air pressure, which prevents the flow of air in between the contaminated area and the areas around it.

<p>For this factor, we developed a four-step technique that permits us to clean the affected area without compromising the rest of your home. We can help bring back the environment in your home and provide permanent treatments that keep mold growth at bay. Set an old box fan or a low-cost brand-new one in a window to aerate the room while working. Toss it out when you're done cleaning, since the spores are practically impossible to clean off. Tape plywood or cardboard around the window openings so the spores can't blow back in<p>
