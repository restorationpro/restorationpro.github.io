<p>If smoke and fire damage has affected your personal belongings, we will work with you and your insurance company to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For products that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged belongings. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into porous surface area, avoiding water from permeating back through. Essentially, it makes the area solid once again and secures the surface from future water damage. After you have applied the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
<p>When we are done, your structure will be ready for more comprehensive repairs, like changing damaged drywall or framing, painting and refinishing floorings. We can customize the available services to your needs and your budget plan, and add other services as necessary, such as floor refinishing or window cleaning.
