<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape.

Utilizing paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth finding out. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.
