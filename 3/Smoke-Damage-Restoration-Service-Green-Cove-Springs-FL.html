It can be a permanent health hazard and should be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater.

This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>A portable dehumidifier can remove water vapor from the air in a consisted of area, like a bed room or downstairs rec space.
