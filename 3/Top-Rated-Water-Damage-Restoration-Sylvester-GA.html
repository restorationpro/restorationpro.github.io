When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a private sewer system can not operate correctly (common pipes issues in old houses ).

When the soil is saturated or flooded, those dangerous materials can enter the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>

<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area.
