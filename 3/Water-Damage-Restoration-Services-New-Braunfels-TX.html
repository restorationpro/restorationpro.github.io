<p>Open doors and windows to eliminate wetness and smells if the weather permits.

<p>Fire is the result of a chemical reaction between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. When this combustible fuel - carpet, drywall, or furnishings - has been heated to its distinct ignition temperature, the fuel will catch fire and volatile gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause long lasting damage and ought to be handled by experienced professionals, heat is the most noticeable, and devastating, product of this chemical reaction.

<p>The most significant element that can be gotten rid of is the moisture that mold requires to cultivate. There are over 100,000 kinds of species of mold, but the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is damp and warm, it starts to sprout and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to become the food source and mycotoxins or harmful gasses are released as the fungis spreads. Mold in your house can be incredibly hazardous and cause a range of health issues. Making effective mold remediation more hard and expensive if the mold in your home is not eliminated properly it can continue to grow.<p>
