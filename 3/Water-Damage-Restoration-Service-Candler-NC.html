<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Since common building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
