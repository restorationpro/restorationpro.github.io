<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is wet and great, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>

Pay special attention to pipelines in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that might not be getting the exact same amount of heat as other locations in your home. Covering them in a layer of insulation can go a long method in avoiding a burst.</p>

<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Longs</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge.
