<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet.

This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
