<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Experts have identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted sprawling suburban houses, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties constructed with products other than stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Since it is a health hazard, many individuals are distressed to remove mold after they find it. But health problems are just the tip of the iceberg when it pertains to motivations for getting rid of mold. Mold can also damage pets, in addition to make the basic structure of the building weaker. Homeowner might not even know that their home is at risk when they identify mold, but it is really unsafe for the integrity of the structure.
