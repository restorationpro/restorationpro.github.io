Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying because the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.</p>
