<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout.
