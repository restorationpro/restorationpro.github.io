<p>Stachybotrys chartarum: this mold is frequently referred to as black mold or harmful mold because of the mycotoxins that it can release. This mold can be hazardous to your health in the form of chronic sinus infections, asthma, and fatigue. It grows in locations that stay constantly wet, like a/c systems. In addition to being hazardous, black mold can also stain surfaces it grows on, which can make it harder to effectively get rid of. Often, surfaces with black mold may need additional whitening or replacement to deal with the spots. In many cases, an encapsulating agent might be essential to cover the stain and any staying spores.</p>
