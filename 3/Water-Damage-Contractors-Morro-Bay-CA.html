<h3>Why You Should Hire Morro Bay Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes. There's no requirement to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water quickly. This might exacerbate the issue since as you know - mold likes moist environments.<p>
<p>Dry completely and quickly. If the energies are on, use the air conditioning or heating unit, fans, and a dehumidifier or desiccants to speed drying. For many types of home repair, it's best to take your time and consider your options before you commit to a certain company's services. Nevertheless, water damage can damage parts of your home within hours, and if you leave parts of your house wet for a week or more, you might need to leave to avoid health hazards.<p>
