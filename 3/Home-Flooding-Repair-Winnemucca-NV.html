<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
