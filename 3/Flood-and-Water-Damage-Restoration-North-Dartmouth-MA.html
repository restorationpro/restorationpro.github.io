<p>Utilize a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, because it might accidentally push liquid into the phone's more delicate parts. You might attempt vacuuming around the phone's cracks and openings to suck more water out if the phone was completely submerged. Once the mold is gone, the chore isn't over yet. Proper cleanup after mold removal is essential to avoid recontamination. You must seal and instantly get rid of products that may have contact with mold, like your mask.
