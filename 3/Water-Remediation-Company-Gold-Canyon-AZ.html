<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a severe health threat, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
