Other times, you may discover little signs like coffee-colored spots that may expand gradually.</p>
<p>If you've just experienced a water event, you might be questioning what to do next: Seeping water damage is progressive, prevalent and can imply valuable items might end up being completely damaged - particularly if emergency reaction is delayed beyond the very first 48 hours.
