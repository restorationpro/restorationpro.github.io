<p>You wish to resolve bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded restroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing completely with the brush, wipe the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
