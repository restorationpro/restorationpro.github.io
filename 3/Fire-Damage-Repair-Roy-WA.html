If there is a great deal of mold development, speak with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ". Printable versions of these and other guidance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement might be necessary.<p>
