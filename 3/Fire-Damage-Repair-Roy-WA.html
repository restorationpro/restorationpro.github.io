Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning!

Printable versions of these and other guidance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement might be necessary.<p>
