<p>Any structure that has actually experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore defense, and cover arms, hands and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold. If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will decrease the incidence of airborne mold spores during cleaning. Next, use business black mold removal products, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair shops, to disinfect the musty areas, in addition to any nearby locations. If you use bleach, ensure it will not discolor the product or surface area. Place all sponges, devices and other products used in cleaning in a strong garbage bag, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a close-by exit rather than the primary home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
