<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air motion across wet surface areas of materials or assemblies is a vital element of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products. Quick air motion throughout the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area moisture gives way to decreasing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The consistent and falling rates of drying materials require different criteria for changing conditions.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health hazard, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Often water flows unseen down the within wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall.
