<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of home damage that a household or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure.
