<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can occur by itself if a fire is contained. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier creates the most affordable humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers take in wetness through chemical attraction rather of condensation to remove water from the air. A desiccant is a material that holds and draws in wetness. This material acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated up exhaust air, the wetness evaporates (desorption) and is carried outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>

A: Mold is a microscopic fungi that is part of the natural environment and required for our ecosystem.
