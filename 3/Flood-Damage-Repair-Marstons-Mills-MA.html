<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold is a typical culprit of damage in a number of our houses and businesses here in Central Illinois. Mold spores can spread out rapidly when moisture is present. Often it can take hold in less than 2 days after a wetness damage has taken place.

If you believe that your home or company has a mold problem, please contact us at 217-528-7775. Our team has the accreditations, knowledge, and experience to remediate the damage.</p>
