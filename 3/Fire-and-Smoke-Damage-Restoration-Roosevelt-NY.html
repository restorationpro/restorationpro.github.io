<p>Mold assessments try to find evidence of mold or mildew development which suggests a water or wetness problem. They can include mold growth around vents, on baseboards or walls, even in your A/C ductwork!

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it travels through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
