<h2>Risks When It Comes to Taylorsville Water Damage in Crawlspaces</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Drooping or musty walls. Any notable sagging in parts of the walls or ceiling is an indication that you need water damage repair services. Drywall 1 droops when saturated with water. Seeing visible mold on the walls is another sign, but not everybody notices mold within their houses. Before mold lies, you may smell a distinct musty aroma or experience allergic reaction symptoms due to mold direct exposure. These smells are especially pungent in areas like the basement. The foul smell resembles the fragrance of damp, musty laundry. Regrettably, it's not uncommon for homeowners to mistake mold development for dirt.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
