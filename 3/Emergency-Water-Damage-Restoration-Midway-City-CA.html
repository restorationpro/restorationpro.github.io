<p>When you are planning large repair work, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is completed.<p>
