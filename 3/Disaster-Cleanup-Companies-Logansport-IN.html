Utilize the fabric on the musty location to remove the mold with the baking soda and water option.<p>

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were really delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
