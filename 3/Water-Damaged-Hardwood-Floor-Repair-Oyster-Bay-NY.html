Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.</p>
