<p>Mold and mildew are kinds of fungi that quickly reach critical mass anywhere wetness is present inside. This can arise from any number of circumstances such as flooding, water accumulation after a fire, a damaged pipeline, or perhaps a malfunctioning HEATING AND COOLING system - all of which can lead to difficulty. Any high degree of moisture, integrated with temperature level and nutrients, develops the perfect environment for the fungal elements of mold and mildew to prosper. It is essential to get rid of the source of the moisture to avoid the spread of mold contamination as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Because large pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged locations bigger than 12 square inches might require a total replacement panel installed. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out. For instance, if the area where you got rid of the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to secure a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you might need to replace the entire drywall panel.</p>
