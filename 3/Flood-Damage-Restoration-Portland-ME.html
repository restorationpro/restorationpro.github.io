<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling since of a dripping roof, condensation from your central air, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and stress, specifically if you have actually never done it previously. Mold requires just three things to make it through and grow: darkness, humidity and moisture. The most typical locations in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling appliances, carpets, ducts and crawlspaces. The best way to prevent mold development is to get rid of water leakages or moisture in your home. See our article, How Do I Avoid Mold Growth?" for mold prevention tips.</p>
<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
