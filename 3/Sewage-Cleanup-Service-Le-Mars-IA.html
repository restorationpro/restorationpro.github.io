<p>You want to deal with bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded bathroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
