Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my main water valve.
