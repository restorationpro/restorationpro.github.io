These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size.
