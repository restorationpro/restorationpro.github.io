These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days.
