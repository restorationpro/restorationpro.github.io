<p>A bleach option also works to kill mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, use to the surface and do not rinse. As household devices get older, their pipes might begin to crack and rust and their connections or hose pipes can weaken as the materials age. Fridges, water heaters, washing dishwaters and devices are all have numerous parts that are vulnerable to degeneration, so keep a mindful watch on older designs. The 2 greatest culprits for water damage in houses are cleaning devices and warm water tanks.<p>
