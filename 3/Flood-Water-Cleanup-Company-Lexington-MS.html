<p>Prior to making any repair work, you need to discover the source of the water leak. This can be frustrating, however if you do not fix the source of the water issue initially, repair work will do you no great. Whether it's a leaky roofing, a damaged pipe or leaking toilet, it can often be hard to locate the source. Water can take a trip far from the leak and cause damage somewhere you would not anticipate it. This means you need to do some expedition and investigation. Eliminate damaged drywall so that you can better see where the leak is coming from (see Action 2) and so you can dry out the water-damaged area.</p>
<p>After you find out how to get rid of mold, concentrate on avoiding it in the future. Controlling moisture is the crucial to stopping most mold.

Stopping leaks, ensuring good ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water far from the foundation are the best defenses versus mold.</p>
