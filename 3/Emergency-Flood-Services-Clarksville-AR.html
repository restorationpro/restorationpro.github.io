Their training consists of safety measures, engineering controls, containment techniques and how to use basic authorized work practices and professionalism.

<p>Cleanup: During the cleaning and restoration stage of the job, your trained cleanup group will utilize the appropriate mix of cleaning agents, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers. Using chem-sponges is imperative in this phase. When it comes into contact with them, a chem-sponge gathers soot and particles. It also prevents streaking on surface areas and walls. Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned up are first cleaned up with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and deodorizing representative. These several actions are required to make sure walls and ceilings are clean and that residual smell has actually been removed.</p>
