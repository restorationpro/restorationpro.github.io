Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier creates the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers take in moisture through chemical attraction instead of condensation to get rid of water from the air. A desiccant is a product that holds and brings in moisture.

<p>Class 3 - greatest amount of evaporation, water, and absorption. Water intrusion where wet, porous products (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), textiles) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the space; and where products described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have taken in very little moisture.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air.
