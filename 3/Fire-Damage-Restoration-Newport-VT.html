We focus on cleaning and fixing properties that have actually suffered fire damage and pursue securing and securing your residential or commercial property from additional damage.

<p>In advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: significant leak or glowing floor heating leakage), repairing the subfloor may even be necessary.

Our professionals will then pressure clean all impacted semi-porous and non-porous building products, such as tile, wood, and cement.
