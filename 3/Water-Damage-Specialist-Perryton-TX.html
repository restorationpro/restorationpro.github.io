<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Perryton</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health threat and should be gotten rid of.

This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
