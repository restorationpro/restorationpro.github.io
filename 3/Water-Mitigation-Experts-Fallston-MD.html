<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were really practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
