Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve.
