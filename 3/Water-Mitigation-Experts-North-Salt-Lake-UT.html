<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in North Salt Lake</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health threat and ought to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>A portable dehumidifier can get rid of water vapor from the air in a contained area, like a bedroom or downstairs rec room. Shut the room's doors and windows to prevent more humidity from seeping in. Buy a big dehumidifier ($ 270) so you don't have to clear its water drawer regularly. First things first. Get the iPhone out of the water immediately, if you have not already. And don't even think about plugging it in.<p>
