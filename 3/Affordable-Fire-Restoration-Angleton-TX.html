<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

Moisture content levels for damp structural products should be tape-recorded in a moisture content spreadsheet to reveal the development of drying These taped moisture material readings will reveal that the structure is back to an appropriate series of pre-loss condition. It is essential to know that air records alone will not show that a building is dry.
