<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a broad area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
