The second step is to secure your home from the work that is going to take place.

<p>Food sources for mold in structures consist of cellulose-based materials such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and organic matter such as soap, materials, and dust including skin cells.

<p>After you learn how to get rid of mold, concentrate on avoiding it in the future. Controlling wetness is the key to stopping most mold. The worst invasions normally happen in damp crawl areas, attics, walls where water leaked in from the outdoors, and in basements with poor foundation drainage. Stopping leakages, ensuring good ventilation in attics, keeping crawl spaces dry and routing water far from the foundation are the best defenses against mold.</p>
<h3>Fire Damage Remediation in Charlevoix</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health danger and need to be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

First, we begin by completely inspecting the structure.
