<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to finish the job appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Don't try or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, drapes or other family fabric products. Those cleaning actions will only smear soot into the fabric, making cleaning more difficult. Utilize a dry, absorbent fabric to wipe down the phone. Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent cloth. Make certain to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume keys, the earphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
