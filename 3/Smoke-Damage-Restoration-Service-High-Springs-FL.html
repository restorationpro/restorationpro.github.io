<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the area you're fixing so that you understand how much brand-new wallboard you require. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a spot to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and after that secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power motorist. Use joint tape to cover the joints where each panel fulfills. Then apply joint substance over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time defined by the maker and then sand the compound with fine-grit sandpaper till the joints are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
