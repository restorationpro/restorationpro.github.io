<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can take place by itself if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier develops the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up wetness through chemical attraction instead of condensation to remove water from the air. A desiccant is a material that attracts and holds moisture. This product acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through warmed exhaust air, the wetness vaporizes (desorption) and is carried outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>The most important element of remedying drywall water damage is to prevent additional damage from mold or mildew. When damp drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew happen most often.

Standard household fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate amount of air required to dry a room effectively.</p>

<p>Corrosion is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide.
