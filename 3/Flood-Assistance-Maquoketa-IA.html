<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible signs of moisture, dripping water, or signs of stopping working structural integrity.

<p>Get rid of the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and get rid of the battery right away. Getting rid of the battery rapidly could make the difference to conserve your phone. Most phones have a white indication near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has damaged the device. You can try to draw the wetness out by immersing the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent material over night. You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you don't hold the vacuum too close to the gadget. Sometimes cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water very long.</p>

If you live in a particularly wet environment, find one with an antimicrobial filter to ensure that the filter itself remains free from mold.</p>
