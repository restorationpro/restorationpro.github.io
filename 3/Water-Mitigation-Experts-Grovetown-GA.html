<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Reaction online, and they were out within the hour. It was a harsh experience, but everything they did for me was great. They best feature of First Response was that they were able to handle my insurance company when they were providing me problems. This probably assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and handled the issue for me, which was a big relief. They were really professional, and I liked everyone I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were managed to my complete satisfaction. I would utilize them again.<p>

Hyphae or roots begin to turn into the food source and mycotoxins or harmful gasses are launched as the fungis spreads.
