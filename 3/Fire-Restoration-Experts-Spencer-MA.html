If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
