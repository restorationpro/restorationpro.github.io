<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Throughout a water loss emergency, nearly every location of your Seattle home could be at danger for damage. Moving water and moisture can permeate porous surface areas and contents, which can modify their appearance and cause irreparable damage within the first 48 hours of exposure.

<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we first look for any security threats, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for confined area entry.

If your insulation has actually been affected, we will remove the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely get rid of it. We will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that prevents water vapor from permeating walls) and eliminate them if they have been damaged.</p>
