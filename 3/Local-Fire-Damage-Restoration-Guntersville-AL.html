<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely devastating. Jake and his men were fantastic in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the method and likewise were very useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
