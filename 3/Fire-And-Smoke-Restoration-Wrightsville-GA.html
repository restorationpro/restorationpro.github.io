<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying since the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Really polite and easy-going person.</p>
