<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his people were fantastic in assisting us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were extremely valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Even when you consist of a little indoor fire, smoke damage can take place.

Also, since it's in the air, it's almost difficult to contain. Even after a fire is snuffed out, smoke in the air can trigger damage.
