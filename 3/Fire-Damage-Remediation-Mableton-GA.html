<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is wet and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings ought to be consisted of in the drying record to include air, devices, and HEATING AND COOLING systems.

It is necessary to understand that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will show if adequate dehumidification is being used or if adjustments are required.</p>
