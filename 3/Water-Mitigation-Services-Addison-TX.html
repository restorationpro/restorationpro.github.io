<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a family or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts right away start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>
