These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
