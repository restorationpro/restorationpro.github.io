This can be discouraging, but if you do not repair the source of the water issue first, repairs will do you no good.

<h3>Why You Should Hire Lenoir City Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health danger and must be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
