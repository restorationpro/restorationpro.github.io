<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth discovering. When the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to finish.<p>
