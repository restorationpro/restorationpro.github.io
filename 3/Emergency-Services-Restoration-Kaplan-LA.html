<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
