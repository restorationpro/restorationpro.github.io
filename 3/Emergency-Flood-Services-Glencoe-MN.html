<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Glencoe</h3>
<p>I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he discovered how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very polite person.<p>
