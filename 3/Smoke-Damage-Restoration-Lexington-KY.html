<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always tries to reach stability. Computing the dew point is essential in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The humidity constantly happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas kind. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid form. The higher the dew point rises, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
