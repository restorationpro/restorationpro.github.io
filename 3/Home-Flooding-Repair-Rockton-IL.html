<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find visible mold development (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Search for indications of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water stains, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical.

There are much safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce harmful fumes or leave behind hazardous residue. For these reasons attempt to avoid using bleach and if you must use it, only use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
