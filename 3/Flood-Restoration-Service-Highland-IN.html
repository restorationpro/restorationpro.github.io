Mold needs simply 3 things to grow and survive: wetness, humidity and darkness. The most typical areas in your home for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling appliances, crawlspaces, ducts and carpets.

Standard home fans are not capable of moving an adequate quantity of air needed to dry a room sufficiently.</p>
