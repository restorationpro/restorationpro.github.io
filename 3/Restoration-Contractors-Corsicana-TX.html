<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of property damage that a household or service can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working.

If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a very costly paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
