Appropriate cleanup after mold removal is necessary to avoid recontamination. You must seal and right away deal with materials that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the boots or shoes you used while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
