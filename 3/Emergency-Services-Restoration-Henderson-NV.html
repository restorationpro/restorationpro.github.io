<p>When you are planning large repair work, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is necessary to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.
