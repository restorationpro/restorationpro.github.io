<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or polluted water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, but a weathered and broke chimney can typically allow rain throughout the chillier months which can permeate through the walls. Over time, wetness from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to bubble, flake and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and exhausted  space.<p>
<p>Cladosporium: This mold might be black or green. (Though it is black in color, it is not the same as black mold.) It grows on the backs of toilets and painted surfaces and in fiberglass air ducts.

We will review your insurance policy with you to figure out the protection that you are entitled to receive for the water damage restoration in your property. As long as you do not need flood cleanup services for damage brought on by an overflowing body of water or homeowner neglect, then you need to have the ability to get coverage from your insurance company.<p>
