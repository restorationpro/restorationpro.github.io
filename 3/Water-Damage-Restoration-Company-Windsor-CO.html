<h3>Fire And Flood Restoration Companies in Windsor</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repairs, bear in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
