<p>Smoke damage is a common negative effects of fire damage, but it can happen by itself if a fire is consisted of. After the standing water has been eliminated and materials that could position a drying or structural risk have actually been eliminated, the drying procedure will start. This typically involves putting fans and a dehumidifier in the area. In many cases, it might also involve installing plastic sheeting and using heating units so that the water can evaporate. If walls have been affected, it may be needed to get rid of baseboards or drill holes so that they dry appropriately. A section of the carpet might also have to be lifted so that the carpet and the pad will dry.

Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
