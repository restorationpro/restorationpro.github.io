<p>The area that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can quickly travel as soon as they are disturbed. Air filtration systems are normally utilized in combination with the sealing of the location to remove as lots of air-borne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location includes using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative air pressure, which avoids the circulation of air in between the contaminated area and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading out as well.</p>
