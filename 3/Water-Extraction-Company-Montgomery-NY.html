Characteristics built with materials aside from stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local firms. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are utilized on any tough surface areas to get rid of the mold from the surface area. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are usually brought offsite for cleaning to make sure all mold spores are removed, generally including deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>

It depends upon where the damage is located on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out.

If not, you may have to change the entire drywall panel.</p>
