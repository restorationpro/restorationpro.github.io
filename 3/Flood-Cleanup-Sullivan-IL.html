<p>Light flooding usually just requires assistance in drying the location out, as well as fundamental cleanup services. These cases need extremely little time, and are simple to restore approximately their full capacity.

Water invasion where damp, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where materials referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually soaked up very little moisture.</p>
