<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Butler</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health danger and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
