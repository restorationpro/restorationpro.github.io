Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal noticeable indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable plaster material. Other times, you may discover little signs like coffee-colored stains that may broaden gradually.</p>
<p>Mold developments (colonies) can develop within 24-48 hours, so it is important to act instantly if you have a water spill or leakage-- especially if you live in a hot or humid  climate.

<p>Corrosion is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide.
