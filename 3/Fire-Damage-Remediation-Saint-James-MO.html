Toll's vice president of building, Anthony Geonnotti, for example, testified in 2017 that, within slightly more than 2 years, he had examined 300 to 350 houses in the region for water invasion-- with roughly 85 percent needing repairs, according to an arbitration hearing transcript filed in court. Countless homeowners have discovered the problems only after it's far too late to bring a claim under state law-- with some missing the deadline by simply months or weeks.</p>

Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
