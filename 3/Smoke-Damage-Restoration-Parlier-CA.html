<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Cleanup: During the cleaning and restoration phase of the job, your skilled cleanup group will use the appropriate mix of cleaning agents, air cleaning gadgets, and deodorizers. The use of chem-sponges is important in this stage. When it comes into contact with them, a chem-sponge collects soot and particles. It also avoids streaking on surface areas and walls.
