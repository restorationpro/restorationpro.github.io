<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold experts usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the service on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. There's no need to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water easily.
