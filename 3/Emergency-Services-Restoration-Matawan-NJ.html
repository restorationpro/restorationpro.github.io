<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By reducing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet.

This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is ended up.<p>
