Since there are often bigger concerns that will stop you from noticing, it is tough to figure out whether your iPhone's speaker has been compromised by water. Just like every water-related problem, leave your iPhone to dry for as long as possible. Backup your information before you try to check the speaker out if you manage to turn your phone back on again.<p>
<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
