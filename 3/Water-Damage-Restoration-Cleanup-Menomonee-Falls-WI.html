<p>Flooding of a personal sewage system can be a hazardous situation for property owners, according to Pipes 2.0's experienced plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It may lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and lack of sanitation until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a private sewer system can not work effectively (typical pipes issues in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to lower the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (viruses, bacteria and protozoa).
