Nutrients for mold are present in dead organic product such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also derive nutrients from some artificial products such as adhesives and paints. Mold needs wetness, although some mold species can get that wetness from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Carefully pry baseboards away from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can quickly take in flood water, and you need to know the extent of prospective damage.<p>
