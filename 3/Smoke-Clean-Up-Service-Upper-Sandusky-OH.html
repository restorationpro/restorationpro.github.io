<p>Current Evaluation: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out how much water expense I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Extremely courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
