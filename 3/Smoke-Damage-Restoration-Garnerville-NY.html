<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings need to be included in the drying record to include hvac, air, and equipment systems. Wetness material levels for wet structural products should be tape-recorded in a moisture material spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These taped moisture material readings will reveal that the building is back to an acceptable variety of pre-loss condition. It is important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will demonstrate if adequate dehumidification is being utilized or if adjustments are needed.</p>
