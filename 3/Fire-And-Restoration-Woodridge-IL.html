<p>Any structure that has actually struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Use a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore defense, and cover legs, hands and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the musty area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will reduce the occurrence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal products, which can be found in most hardware or home repair stores, to sanitize the musty locations, in addition to any adjacent areas. Make sure it won't discolor the material or surface if you use bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials used in cleaning in a strong trash can, and if possible, remove the bag through a neighboring exit rather than the primary home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to do the job properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
